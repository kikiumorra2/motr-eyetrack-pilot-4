# MoTR experiment template

A blank, ready-to-clone project for **Mouse Tracking for Reading (MoTR)** experiments
(Wilcox, Cui & Ćeplö, 2024). MoTR approximates eye-tracking in the browser: the text is
blurred and a small sharp window follows the mouse, so where the mouse goes is where the
participant reads. The app records which *character* is under the cursor with millisecond
timestamps (from every hardware mouse report, stored as compact change events — or, in the
legacy mode, the word under the cursor every 50 ms), and the postprocessing pipeline turns
those records into fixation-like "associations" and standard reading measures (first-pass,
gaze, go-past, …).

The app is built on [magpie](https://magpie-experiments.org/) (Vue 2), using the
[`magpie-base-MoTR`](https://github.com/cuierd/magpie-base-MoTR) fork.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <this repo> my-experiment && cd my-experiment
npm install                 # Node 16 recommended (.nvmrc); 18–22 work via scripts/vue-cli.js
npm run serve               # http://localhost:8080  (mode: "debug" → nothing is sent anywhere)
```

Open the browser console to see the trial sequence and, in debug mode, the rows that
would be submitted.

## Setting up a new experiment

1. **Materials** – edit `materials/items.csv`, `fillers.csv`, `practice.csv` (schema in
   `materials/README.md`), then `python scripts/make_lists.py`. Rebuild after any change.
2. **Settings** – `src/config.js`: experiment name, practice/filler counts, the post-sentence
   question (per-item questions go in the CSV), zoom check, completion code. Then
   `src/magpie.config.js`: the server that receives the data (`serverUrl`), the experiment
   ID you created there, and `mode` (see *Where the data goes*).
3. **Text** – consent form and instructions in `src/App.vue` (look for `[INSTITUTION]`,
   `[DURATION]`, `[IRB / ETHICS COMMITTEE]`).
4. **Test** – `npm run serve`, run through the experiment, check the console output. Try
   `?LIST_ID=2` to force a list.
5. **Deploy** – push to GitHub (`main` or `master`); the workflow builds and publishes to the `gh-pages`
   branch (enable Pages → branch `gh-pages` in the repo settings). The study URL is
   `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/?LIST_ID=1`. Alternatively `npm run build` and host
   `dist/` anywhere (`npm start` serves it with Express).
6. **Recruit** – with `mode: "prolific"`, add `&PROLIFIC_PID={{%PROLIFIC_PID%}}` to the study
   URL; the ID is pre-filled on the consent screen and participants are redirected to
   `completionUrl` at the end. One Prolific study per list, or `defaultList: "random"`.
7. **Analyse** – download the results from the server and run one command
   (see `postprocessing/README.md` for the step-by-step version):

   ```bash
   python3 postprocessing/run_pipeline.py --experiment-id 42 --csv results/raw/export.csv
   ```

## Where the data goes

Every trial's rows are sent as soon as the trial ends (`submitEachTrial` in `config.js`),
and the survey row at the very end, by `src/submit.js`:

```
POST {serverUrl}/api/submit_experiment/{experimentId}      body: JSON array of rows
```

`serverUrl` and `experimentId` live in `src/magpie.config.js`, so any magpie backend
(magpie-serverless, a self-hosted magpie server) is a one-line change. To send the data
somewhere else entirely, replace the body of `submitRows()` in `src/submit.js` — that is
the only place data leaves the browser. In `debug` mode nothing is sent; the rows are
printed to the browser console.

## Browser check

MoTR's window and word boxes are defined in CSS pixels, so browser zoom changes their
physical size. After consent, a check screen asks participants to set the zoom to 100 %
(Ctrl/⌘ + 0) and only continues once it is (estimated from
`window.outerWidth / window.innerWidth`, which tracks zoom in desktop Chrome, Firefox and
Edge; a "continue anyway" link appears after 30 s in case the estimate is wrong on some
setup). The zoom level, device pixel ratio and window size are recorded with every trial
(`zoomPercent`, `devicePixelRatio`, `windowInnerWidth/Height`) and screen size / user agent
in the survey row, so you can also filter afterwards. Settings: `browserCheck` in
`src/config.js`.

## How the interface works

`MotrTrial.vue` renders the sentence twice, exactly overlaid: a blurred black copy and a
sharp white copy split into one `<span>` per word. A white oval with
`mix-blend-mode: difference` follows the cursor, inverting the white text to black and
cancelling the blur under it – the moving "window". Because the spans receive the mouse
events, `document.elementFromPoint` tells us which word is under the cursor.

What gets recorded depends on `samplingMode` in `src/config.js`:

- **`"events"` (default)** — the character-event recorder (`src/charEvents/`). When a trial
  starts, the box of every character is measured once (with DOM `Range`s over the existing
  word spans, so nothing about the rendering changes). Every pointer sample the hardware
  delivers (`pointermove` + `getCoalescedEvents()`, typically 125–1000 Hz) is hit-tested
  against those boxes with the same rule the legacy sampler uses (`(x, y)`, then
  `(x, y − 3)`, else "no word"), and only *changes* of the character under the cursor are
  kept, with their millisecond timestamps. Optionally every raw sample is kept too, delta-coded
  (~3 bytes each). The layout is re-measured on resize/scroll/zoom/font load. "Done Reading"
  closes the recording and stores **one row per trial** (`TrialType = "charEvents"`, fields
  `mtFormat/mtLayout/mtEvents/mtTrace/mtStats`; format spec: `src/charEvents/FORMAT.md`).
  A typical trial is ~5–10 KB instead of ~60–100 KB.
- **`"interval"`** — the original sampler: every `sampleIntervalMs` while the cursor is over
  the text, a row is recorded with `Index`/`Word`, the word's bounding box, and the mouse
  position; magpie adds `responseTime`. "Done Reading" records an end-of-reading marker
  (`Index = -1`) so the last word's fixation can be closed.
- **`"both"`** — both at once, for validation studies.

Which one? `"events"` unless you have a reason: it is the default, records everything the
hardware reports, and yields the same reading measures as the 50 ms sampler on the same
movement — to the millisecond rather than to the tick (`postprocessing/READING_MEASURES.md`
§3.2 and §4.12 list the differences). Use `"interval"` to reproduce a published 20 Hz MoTR
study exactly (or pass `--resample 50` to the pipeline, which turns the events into the same
50 ms rows). `"both"` roughly doubles each trial's payload and is meant for validation; the
pipeline then uses the legacy rows unless you pass `--char-events expand`.

`postprocessing/1_fetch_and_flatten.py` expands charEvents rows back into the classic
per-sample rows (one row per character change, plus the marker), so the rest of the pipeline
is identical for all modes; it also writes a character-level table.

In every mode, after "Done Reading" the question is shown. "Next" records a trial-summary
row and, with `submitEachTrial`, immediately sends that trial's rows to the server (per-trial
submission means a dropout still leaves usable data). See the comment block at the top of
`MotrTrial.vue` for the full column list.

### Restyling: font size and the spotlight

Layout details that the data depends on: `font-size: 18px; line-height: 40px;` on
`.main_screen` and `padding: 2% 11%` on both text layers. Keep `.readingText` and
`.blurry-layer` identical (font, weight, padding) or the sharp and blurred copies drift apart.
`test/browser/harness.html` copies those three rules so the parity tests run against the real
layout — change them there too.

**The spotlight does not scale with the font.** Every dimension of the moving window is a
fixed pixel value carried over from the original MoTR experiment, and nothing is computed
from text metrics — the JS only toggles the `.grow` / `.blank` classes. So raising
`font-size` leaves a 102 × 38 px window over larger glyphs: it covers fewer characters, and
the 5 px page blur bites less (big blurred glyphs stay readable). Lower the font and the
window spans more words while the blur bites harder. The 38 px oval is also tuned to sit
inside one 40 px line, so raising `font-size` without raising `line-height` makes the window
bleed into the lines above and below.

To make it track the font instead, put these in `em` — the values below are today's pixel
sizes ÷ 18, so at `font-size: 18px` the screen renders exactly as it does now — and from then
on change only `font-size` on `.main_screen`:

| Where (`MotrTrial.vue`) | Now | In `em` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.oval-cursor.grow` width / height | `102px` / `38px` | `5.667em` / `2.111em` |
| `.oval-cursor.grow.blank` width / height | `80px` / `13px` | `4.444em` / `0.722em` |
| `.oval-cursor.grow` `filter: blur()` | `3px` | `0.167em` |
| `.oval-cursor.grow` `box-shadow` | `±30px 0 8px -4px` | `±1.667em 0 0.444em -0.222em` |
| `.blurry-layer` `filter: blur()` (inline style in the template) | `5px` | `0.278em` |
| `.main_screen` `line-height` | `40px` | `2.222` (unitless) |
| cursor offset in `onMouseMove` | `x + 12`, `y - 6` | move into CSS, below |

`.oval-cursor.grow::before` (the bright core) is already `70%` of the oval, so it follows for
free, and the collapsed `1px` base state can stay as it is. Making `line-height` unitless is
what keeps the oval-height-to-line-pitch ratio invariant, so the window stays within one line
at any size.

The cursor offset is applied from JS in pixels and has to move into the CSS transform to
scale. It is purely cosmetic — hit testing uses the raw `clientX`/`clientY`, never the oval's
geometry — so this is safe:

```js
// MotrTrial.vue, onMouseMove
cursor.style.left = `${x}px`; // was `${x + 12}px`
cursor.style.top = `${y}px`; // was `${y - 6}px`
```

```css
/* .oval-cursor — was transform: translate(-50%, -50%); declared once, all states share it */
transform: translate(calc(-50% + 0.667em), calc(-50% - 0.333em));
```

Two constraints:

- **`em` on the oval resolves against `.main_screen`'s font size.** `.oval-cursor` is a
  descendant of it (`position: fixed` changes the containing block, but `em` follows the
  inheritance chain), so the one knob has to stay `font-size` on `.main_screen`. Setting the
  size on `.readingText` alone would grow the text and leave the window behind.
- **Do not scale the hit-test constant.** `LOOK_ABOVE_PX = 3` (`src/charEvents/layout.js`) and
  the matching `y - 3` fallback in `MotrTrial.vue`'s `wordAt` decide *which character is
  recorded*, not what the participant sees. They must stay equal to each other, and changing
  them breaks equivalence with the legacy 20 Hz sampler and with published MoTR data. If you
  do change it, change both and re-run `npm test` — the browser tests check the rule against
  the real engine.

Browser zoom is not an alternative knob: it scales all CSS px together, text and window alike
(`zoomPercent` is recorded per trial). After any restyle, run `npm test` and open a trial to
confirm the window still sits within a single line.

## Data format

Each submission is one JSON array of rows. Its **first row** carries the experiment-level data
(`SubjectId`, `ListId`, `Experiment`, `experiment_start_time`, …): magpie itself only puts that
on the first row of *all* recorded data, so `src/submit.js` adds it to every per-trial submission
and to the survey row (step 1 spreads it over the submission's other rows). Rows hold either sample columns,
the per-trial `charEvents` fields (`samplingMode: "events"`; see `src/charEvents/FORMAT.md`)
or summary columns; magpie fills absent columns with `""`. `1_fetch_and_flatten.py` reads
both export formats — the magpie-serverless *Download results* CSV (already flattened, one
line per row, grouped by `submission_id`) and the classic results-table dump (`id`,
`experiment_id`, `results` with one JSON array per submission) — and produces the flat CSV
documented in `postprocessing/README.md`.

## Verifying an experiment end-to-end

Before recruiting, run the whole path once yourself — ten minutes, and it catches the
configuration mistakes no unit test can:

1. `npm run serve` with `mode: "debug"`, complete a few trials, then in the browser console
   run `copy(JSON.stringify(window.__motrRows))` and paste the result into `rows.json`.
   `python3 postprocessing/motr_char_events.py --check rows.json` decodes every trial and,
   with `samplingMode: "both"`, reports how often the 50 ms rows agree with the character
   events (expect ≥ 95 %; the disagreements are the end-marker row, timer ticks a few ms
   after a pointer sample, and — on hardware that reports fractional pointer positions —
   moments when the pointer rests within 1 px of a box edge, see `src/charEvents/FORMAT.md`). `python3 postprocessing/plot_char_events.py --rows
   rows.json --item <item>` draws the scanpath, the character boxes and the raw trace.
2. Point `src/magpie.config.js` at your server and experiment ID with `mode: "directLink"`,
   complete one full session (enter a 24-character hex ID on the consent screen so
   `--require-prolific-id` accepts it), download the results and run
   `python3 postprocessing/run_pipeline.py --experiment-id <ID> --csv <download> --require-prolific-id`.
   In `results/exp_<ID>/participants_*.csv` expect one row for you with `n_trials` equal to
   the number of trials you completed and `device`/`hand` from the survey; the pipeline's
   last step (`check_reading_measures.py`) verifies the reading measures themselves and fails
   loudly if anything is inconsistent.
3. Exclude that test participant from the real analysis.

## Tests

```bash
npm test                     # JS unit tests (node:test, Node >= 22): codecs, hit test,
                             #   recorder, decoder, legacy equivalence, cross-language fixtures,
                             #   submission rows, and a headless-Chrome check when Chrome is installed
npm run test:perf            # strict throughput / payload-size thresholds
python -m pip install -r postprocessing/requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest postprocessing          # Python decoder + pipeline tests, including the
                                         #   end-to-end run over simulated data (-m "not slow" skips it)
```

The JS and Python implementations of the `motr-ce/1` format are pinned to each other by
`test/fixtures/*.json`: scenarios encoded on one side must decode — and re-encode
byte-for-byte — on the other. Regenerate with `npm run fixtures` /
`MOTR_WRITE_FIXTURES=1 python -m pytest postprocessing` after changing the format.
`.github/workflows/test.yml` runs everything on push.

## Requirements

- Node 16 (see `.nvmrc`); newer versions work because `scripts/vue-cli.js` adds
  `--openssl-legacy-provider`. npm ≥ 7 (installs magpie's peer dependencies).
- Python ≥ 3.9 for postprocessing; `run_pipeline.py` installs `pandas`/`numpy`/`matplotlib`
  into a private `.venv/` by itself.
