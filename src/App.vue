        <p>
          <b>What is being investigated?</b> You are being asked to take part in a research
          study being done at [INSTITUTION]. This study will help us learn about how people

        <p>
          <b>What am I supposed to do as a participant?</b> If you choose to be in the study,
          you will use the computer mouse to read sentences in English and answer questions
          about them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What are my rights during participation?</b> Your participation in this study is
          voluntary. If you choose to participate, you may change your mind and leave the
          study at any time by closing the web page. You do not have to provide reasons.

        <p>
          <b>Will I be compensated for participating?</b> If you complete the experiment, you
          will be compensated for your time according to the amount specified on Prolific.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What data is collected from me and how is it used?</b> During this study, we will
          track the position of your mouse on screen. At the end of the study you will be
          asked to complete a brief survey. No personally identifying information will be
          collected. The data from this study may be presented at scientific conferences and
          published in scientific journals, as well as in online repositories. All data will
          remain anonymous.

        In this study, you will read sentences. Unlike in normal reading, however, the text
        will be blurred. To bring the text into focus, move your mouse over it. When you are
        done reading, click the <b>Done Reading</b> button.

        After each sentence you will be asked a question about it. Indicate your answer by
